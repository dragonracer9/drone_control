# Drone control

NOTE: This is a private project and I havent been able to work on it much.

I was heavily inspired by [jyjblrd's Mocap-Drones](https://github.com/jyjblrd/Mocap-Drones), which I saw on youtube.

Dependencies: [libusb](https://libusb.info/) on Windows (not required on Linux or Mac). This is a dependency of pseyepy.

TODOs:

* Connect to IOT ESPN board with sockets -> understand socketIO
* update controller for drones (currently PID, try MPC)
*
